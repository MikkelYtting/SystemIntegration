Inevitably some aircraft were lost, with at least two falling more-or-less intact into Chinese hands. The first known example, an A6M2 (the 12th of the 15th pre-production aircraft, Serial V-110), fell near Fainan Island. On 18 September 1940 a team, including Western volunteers assisting the Chinese, examined the wreck. It was largely intact, and a detail report was compiled and sent to the U.S. The second, an A6M2-21 (Serial V-173), made a forced landing near Tietsan airfield 17 February 1941. The pilot was shot before he could destroy his plane, the fuel system fixed, and it was taken into Chinese service. The plane was extensively flown and studied by a team which included ", ", and a detailed and illustrated report was sent to Washington.

Losing oil, Flight Petty Officer Tadayoshi Koga attempted an emergency landing on Akutan Island about 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Dutch Harbor, but his Zero flipped over on soft ground in a sudden crash-landing. Koga died instantly of head injuries (his neck was broken by the tremendous impact), but his wingmen hoped he had survived and so went against Japanese doctrine to destroy disabled Zeros.", " The relatively undamaged fighter was found over a month later by an American salvage team and was shipped to ", ", where testing flights of the repaired A6M revealed both strengths and deficiencies in design and performance.", "\n", "The experts who evaluated the captured Zero found that the plane weighed about 2,360 kg (5,200 lb) fully loaded, some 1,260 kg (2,780 lb) lighter than the F4F Wildcat, the standard United States Navy fighter of the time. The A6M's airframe was \"built like a fine watch\"; the Zero was constructed with ", ", and even the guns were flush with the wings. The instrument panel was a \"marvel of simplicity… with no superfluities to distract [the pilot]\". What most impressed the experts was that the Zero's fuselage and wings were constructed in one piece, unlike the American method that built them separately and joined the two parts together. The Japanese method was much slower but resulted in a very strong structure and improved close maneuverability.", "\n", "American test pilots found that the Zero's controls were \"very light\" at 320 km/h (200 mph) but stiffened at speeds above 348 km/h (216 mph) to safeguard against wing failure.", " The Zero could not keep up with Allied aircraft in high-speed maneuvers, and its low \"", "\" (V", ") made it vulnerable in a dive. Testing also revealed that the Zero could not roll as quickly to the right as it could to the left, which could be exploited.", " While stable on the ground despite its light weight, the aircraft was designed purely for the attack role, emphasizing long range, maneuverability, and firepower at the expense of protection of its pilot. Most lacked self-sealing tanks and armor plating.", "\n", "Captain ", ", the chief naval test pilot of the ", ", recalled being impressed by the Zero during tests of captured aircraft. \"I don't think I have ever flown a fighter that could match the rate of turn of the Zero.

By September, it had already been accepted for Navy testing as the A6M1 Type 0 Carrier Fighter, with the only notable change being a switch to a three-bladed propeller to cure a vibration problem.\n", "While the Navy was testing the first two prototypes, they suggested that the third be fitted with the 700 kW (940 hp) ", " 12 engine instead. Mitsubishi had its own engine of this class in the form of the ", ", so they were somewhat reluctant to use the Sakae. Nevertheless, when the first A6M2 was completed in January 1940, the Sakae's extra power pushed the performance of the Zero well past the original specifications.\n", "The new version was so promising that the Navy had 15 built and shipped to China before they had completed testing.

In one encounter, 13 Zeros shot down 27 I-15s and I-16s in under three minutes without loss. After hearing of these reports, the Navy immediately ordered the A6M2 into production as the Type 0 Carrier Fighter, Model 11.\nReports of the Zero's performance slowly filtered back to the US. They were met with scepticism by most US military officials, who thought it impossible for the Japanese to build such an aircraft.\n", "After the delivery of the 65th aircraft, a further change was worked into the production lines, which introduced folding wingtips to allow them to fit on aircraft carriers.", " The resulting Model 21 would become one of the most produced versions early in the war. A feature was the improved range with 520 L (140 US gal) wing tank and 320 L (85 US gal) drop tank. When the lines switched to updated models, 740 Model 21s had been completed by Mitsubishi, and another 800 by Nakajima. Two other versions of the Model 21 were built in small numbers, the Nakajima-built A6M2-N \"Rufe\" floatplane (based on the Model 11 with a slightly modified tail), and the A6M2-K two-seat trainer of which a total of 508 were built by Hitachi and the Sasebo Naval Air Arsenal.", "\n", "In 1941, Nakajima introduced the Sakae 21 engine, which used a two-speed ", " for better altitude performance, and increased power to 831 kW (1,130 hp). A prototype Zero with the new engine was first flown on 15 July 1941.", "\n", "The new Sakae was slightly heavier and somewhat longer due to the larger supercharger, which moved the ", " too far forward on the existing airframe. To correct for this, the engine mountings were cut back by 185 mm (7.3 in) to move the engine toward the cockpit. This had the side effect of reducing the size of the main fuselage fuel tank (located between the engine and the cockpit) from 518 L (137 US gal) to 470 L (120 US gal). The cowling was redesigned to enlarge the cowl flaps, revise the oil cooler air intake, and move the carburetor air intake to the upper half of the cowling.", "\n", "The wings were redesigned to reduce span, eliminate the folding tips, and square off the wingtips. The inboard edge of the aileron was moved outboard by one rib, and the wing fuel tanks were enlarged accordingly to 420 L (110 US gal). The two 20 mm wing cannon were upgraded from the ", " to the Mark 2,", " which required a bulge in the sheet metal of the wing below each cannon. The wings also included larger ammunition boxes and thus allowing 100 rounds per cannon.\n", "The Sakae 21 engine and other changes increased maximum speed by only 11 km/h (6.8 mph) compared to the Model 21, but sacrificed nearly 1,000 km (620 mi) of range.", " Nevertheless, the Navy accepted the type and it entered production in April 1942.", "\n", "The shorter wingspan led to better roll, and the reduced drag allowed the diving speed to be increased to 670 km/h (415 mph). On the downside, turning and range, which were the strengths of the Model 21, suffered due to smaller ailerons, decreased lift and greater fuel consumption. The shorter range proved a significant limitation during the Solomons Campaign, during which Zeros based at Rabaul had to travel nearly to their maximum range to reach Guadalcanal and return.", " Consequently, the Model 32 was unsuited to that campaign", " and was used mainly for shorter range offensive missions and interception.\n", "This variant was flown by only a small number of units, and only 343 were built. One example survives today, and is on display at the ", " in ", ".", "\n", "In order to correct the deficiencies of the Model 32, a new version with folding wingtips and redesigned wing was introduced. The fuel tanks were moved to the outer wings, fuel lines for a 330 L (87 US gal) drop tank were installed under each wing and the internal fuel capacity was increased to 570 L (150 US gal). More importantly, it regained its capabilities for long operating ranges, similar to the previous A6M2 Model 21, which was vastly shortened by the Model 32.\n", "However, before the new design type was accepted formally by the Navy, the A6M3 Model 22 already stood ready for service in December 1942. Approximately 560 aircraft of the new type had been produced in the meantime by Mitsubishi Jukogyo K.K.", "\n", "According to a theory, the very late production Model 22 might have had wings similar to the shortened, rounded-tip wing of the Model 52.", " One plane of such arrangement was photographed at ", " (\"Rabaul East\") in the second half of 1943, and has been published widely in a number of Japanese books.

However, \"A6M4\" does appear in a translation of a captured Japanese memo from a Naval Air Technical Arsenal, titled Quarterly Report on Research Experiments, dated 1 October 1942.", " It mentions a \"cross-section of the A6M4 intercooler\" then being designed. Some researchers believe \"A6M4\" was applied to one or two prototype planes fitted with an experimental turbo-supercharged Sakae engine designed for high altitude.", " Mitsubishi's involvement in the project was probably quite limited or nil; the unmodified Sakae engine was made by Nakajima.", " The design and testing of the turbo-supercharger was the responsibility of the First Naval Air [Technical] Arsenal (", ", ", ") at Yokosuka.", " At least one photo of a prototype plane exists. It shows a turbo unit mounted in the forward left fuselage.\n", "Lack of suitable alloys for use in the manufacture of a turbo-supercharger and its related ducting caused numerous ruptures, resulting in fires and poor performance. Consequently, further development of a turbo-supercharged A6M was cancelled. The lack of acceptance by the Navy suggests that it did not bestow model number 41 or 42 formally, although it appears that the arsenal did use the designation \"A6M4\". The prototype engines nevertheless provided useful experience for future engine designs.", "\n", "Sometimes considered as the most effective variant,", " the Model 52 was developed to again shorten the wings to increase speed and dispense with the folding wing mechanism.

Travelling to there, he left Edinburgh on 19 September and sailed 14 October 1829.", "\n", "After an adventurous voyage during which he was twice shipwrecked, Duff arrived in ", " on 27 May 1830. After inspecting the Bengali schools, he concluded that students were not receiving an adequate education in a broad range of subjects and secondly, that he would instruct his students using English instead of the local dialects. He at once identified himself with a policy which had far-reaching effects. Christian missions in India had been successful only in converting a few low-caste groups from a poor socio-economic background. The upper caste ", " and ", " communities had been practically untouched. Duff shrewdly assessed that these affluent communities could not be accessed by traditional evangelical methods. He recognised that holding out the prospect of upward mobility, by offering a western education, would bring the children of the affluent classes into his range of influence, which could then be extended to encompass religion. Duff devised the policy by using a western system of education to slowly convert Hindus and Muslims to ", ". The success of his work had the effect:\n", "By teaching ", " courses as well as courses in the physical sciences, Duff hoped that students would logically come to realize the contradictions and impracticality of Hinduism and embrace wholeheartedly the truth of Christianity.   While a few students converted, Duff seems to have widely miscalculated the resilience of Hinduism as well as its ability to adapt itself to western knowledge. Whereas Duff and many of his fellow ", " saw Christianity and ", " as diametrically opposed, Hindus did not generally consider the knowledge either tradition provided as mutually exclusive with the other.", "\n", "Duff opened a school in which all kinds of secular subjects were taught, from the rudiments upwards to a university standard, alongside the Bible. The English language was used as the medium of instruction on the grounds that it was the key to Western knowledge. Alexander Duff proposed a theory which he called the \"downward filter theory\" in which he believed that by catering to the middle and upper social classes, the knowledge of Christianity would eventually filter down the social ladder. Although he promoted the teaching of English in schools, he still viewed the vernacular as an important language for spreading Christianity among \"the masses\" but deemed it inferior to the English language because it was not progressive. Duff wrote a pamphlet on the question, entitled ", ". A government minute was adopted on 7 March 1835, to the effect that in higher education, the object of the ", " should be the promotion of European science and literature among the natives of India, and that all funds appropriated for purposes of education would be best employed on English education alone.", " His views influenced ", ", a pioneering educator, linguist and missionary who worked in ", " dominant ", " in ", ".", "\n", "Within the British Indian community of that era, there were not lacking those \"", "\" who saw value in the traditional learning of India and wished to support and encourage it.

The location was a source of controversy for the Missions Committee who wanted to remain at the heart of Bengali society in the city of Calcutta.  In 1834, Duff returned to Britain broken in health. During this sojourn, he succeeded in securing the approval of his church for his educational plans, and in arousing much interest in the work of foreign missions.", " His struggles were described in a speech at ", " on 8 May 1837 that called for hundreds of thousands of new teachers for India.", "\n", "In 1836, the Calcutta institution was moved to Gorachand Bysack's house in the Garanhata neighbourhood.

A passionate advocate of reform he banished corporal punishments for girls, striving to Christianise education through humane methods of teaching.  In seeking out ", " for a new Baptist mission, he emphasised the inter-denominational character of united prayer events. He was unassuming, modest, pious, and quite uninterested in the politics of popery and anti-papism.  Yet only the Episcopalians remained beyond his reach with their broad brush ", " publications.  Despite the perceived handicap he could influence serious political figures in the Indian civil Service through the media of ", "  In one article he made an advancement in liberal theology exposing the cruelty of ", " (1844).  And in the same year his power in the Free Church was rehearsed in a lecture to The Free Churchmen of Calcutta in the Masonic Hall.  Its title \"The Sole and Supreme Headship of the Lord Jesus Christ over His Own Church, or a voice from the Ganges relative to the courses which led to the recent disruption...\" symbolised his conviction in the supremacy of Christianity to bring enlightened education to Indians.  Two Bengali intellectuals travelled to Edinburgh to be baptised at Duff's request.  ", " and ", " were closely watched by Dr ", ", a renowned writer and church leader.  Dr. Chalmers death in 1847 was a real blow to the Free Church; and to Duff, his pupil and then successor as professor.  It forced Duff to deny his Scottishness to maintain a life dedicated to working in India, he refused the principalship in 1874.  Duff knew him well in the cultural capital of Scotland pursuing moral, material and spiritual development while steering his charges away from the temptations of Heathenism.  During 1845–46 he conducted numerous Indian conversions with typical missionary zeal. Exhibiting a strong sense of Scottish character he personified individual freedoms baptizing Jewish refugees, overcoming prejudice, and persisting in the face of prohibitive rules among the Hindu caste system.  A tireless campaigner, and restless traveller from Calcutta to Ceylon he visited thousands of missionaries and their stations. A profound sense of duty was monitored by legal correctness of his own opinions, that never ceased to improve.  Deeply rooted in the doctrine of justification by faith alone he mixed doctrinal worship with regular business committees to raise money for the church.  Eloquent, he recalled the poems of ", " as closely as he expounded the values of liberal Zionsim.  Richly endowed by a Jacobite tradition that informed a fierce feeling of injustice.  On being appointed Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland in 1851 he was asked by Lord Granville to testify to the House of Lords in which he hoped to influence the ", " of 1854.", " Disappointed by the slow progress of change, he embarked on a trip to America.  At Washington DC Dr Duff addressed the Congress.  In Toronto he gave a sermon to Kroom's Church.  On his last day he preached at the ", " where he received benediction.  Hugely popular, he was bade farewell by weeping crowds from the Hudson River wharves on 13 May 1854.  Back in England he was met by Lord Haddo, son of Prime Minister, Lord Aberdeen.  After sipping the Malvern Spa waters for a cure, he decided on a Grand Tour of Europe and the Holy Land with his friend Dr James Lumsden.  At his death he was acclaimed by scot William Ewart Gladstone as an heroic, apostolic saint.  A memorial celtic cross was erected at Pitlochry parish church to celebrate a life of deep christian service.\n", "He married 30 July 1829, Anne Scott Drysdale, Edinburgh (died 22 February 1865), and had issue – \n", "Alexander Duff was incredibly influential in Indian education and government and set several precedents. Almost as soon as he arrived his evangelising changed Indian education: in 1832 another Scot, ", " established a school in Bombay.  Duff's methods were widely imitated and his cumulative twenty-five years in the subcontinent were largely characterized by the establishment of western-style educational institutions warmly received by ", ". Duff can be credited with creating a framework that influenced educational policy and practice during the nineteenth century and beyond. Since his schools catered mostly to the Hindu middle class, he was able to receive attention from the government which helped to spread his methods and ideas.  Several other English schools were established because the General Assemblies Institution was so successful.  The success and influence of Duff's college led to the founding of the Calcutta Medical College.  Hindu scriptures forbid people of higher castes from touching dead bodies, which prevented medical students from performing cadaver dissections.  Students from Duff's college expressed that their liberal, English education had \"freed their minds from prejudice and the dissection of the human body was not objectionable to them.\"", " This new idea allowed higher caste Indians to pursue medical professions, therefore advancing healthcare in India.\n", "The top-down theory of education described above typifies Duff's evangelical elitism, one of the main elements of his legacy in the subcontinent. Duff seems to have believed that there was a direct relationship between education and missionary work. Not only was the education of the Indian people critical to his goal of dispelling \"Hindu ignorance\" but it was in fact the duty of evangelicals to modernize and instruct Indian society using Western ideals and texts.  While Duff was a highly skilled scholar who was devoted to India, his evangelistic ideals and western prejudice may have influenced his students in ways that he did not anticipate. Instead of initiating a mass conversion to Christianity he may have instead provided another catalyst for Hindu reform movements.", "\n", "Duff hoped that through a western education in a time of enlightenment, Indians would be able to see the flaws in their religion and be compelled to convert to Christianity, but he did not consider the resilience of the Hindu religion and his efforts proved to be fairly unsuccessful on the broader scale.", " Educations of the Christian bible was accepted by Hindus because they were confident in their own religion and were not worried that their children would lose their faith. Hinduism was not only a religion but a culture, and the occupation of the British and their ideas was not drastic enough to change this.  Because Alexander Duff was regarded well, his character served as a model to his students and friends and his teaching did eventually lead to some reformist movements within Hinduism.  In fact, Duff's work led to the acceptance of more Indians into public official positions in government.", " This experience was critical to the transitional Indian government after Independence in 1947. A Church was established in 1848 and named as ", " in 1910 in memory of Alexander Duff.", " Another church, in ", ", Scotland, is named ", " in his honour.", " Duff attended primary school in the village.", "\n"]},

Consequently, turbochargers were mainly employed in American aircraft engines such as the ", " and the ", ", which were comparably heavier when turbocharged, and required additional ducting of expensive high-temperature ", " in the ", " and a pre-turbine section of the exhaust system. The size of the ducting alone was a serious design consideration.

When both artists undertook their solo careers, Camarón became a mythical cantaor for his art and personality, with a legion of followers, while Paco de Lucía reconfigured the entire musical world of flamenco, opening up to new influences, such as Brazilian music, Arabic and jazz and introducing new musical instruments such as the Peruvian cajon, the transverse flute, etc.\n", "Other leading performers in this process of formal flamenco renewal were ", ", who married flamenco with Andalusian music, and ", ", who throughout his long artistic career has oscillated between the purism of his first recordings and the crossbreeding with rock, or ", " from ", ", cultivator of a unique style of ", " from Extremadura, and a wedge of purity in her cante make her part of this select group of established artists.

If there is no guitarist available, the compás is rendered through hand clapping (", ") or by hitting a table with the knuckles. The guitarist uses techniques like strumming (", ") or tapping the ", " (", "). Changes of chords emphasize the most important downbeats.\n", "Flamenco uses three basic counts or measures: Binary, Ternary and a form of a twelve-beat cycle that is unique to flamenco.

In real life it is counted from 1 like: 1 ", " 3 ", " 5 6 and so on.\n", "The posture and technique of flamenco guitarists, called \"tocaores\", differs from that used by the players of classical guitar. While the classical guitarist supports the guitar on his left leg in an inclined way, the flamenco guitarist usually crosses his legs and supports it on the one that is higher, placing the neck in an almost horizontal position with respect to the ground. Modern guitarists usually use classical guitars, although there is a specific instrument for this genre called ", ". This is less heavy, and its body is narrower than that of the classical guitar, so its sound is lower and does not overshadow the cantaor. It is usually made of ", " wood, with the handle of ", " and the top of ", ". The cypress gives it a brilliant sound very suitable for the characteristics of flamenco. Formerly, the palo santo from Rio or India was also used, being the first of higher quality, but currently it is in disuse due to its scarcity. The palo santo gave guitars an amplitude of sound especially suitable for solo playing. At present, the most widely used ", " is the metal one, since the wooden one poses ", " problems.\n", "The main guitar makers were ", " Jurado (", ", 1817–1892) considered the father of the guitar, ", ", the Great Ramírez (Madrid, 1864 -1920), and his disciples Santos Hernández (Madrid, 1873–1943),", " who built several guitars for the maestro ", ", ", " and ", ". Also noteworthy are the Conde Brothers, Faustino (1913–1988), Mariano (1916–1989) and Julio (1918–1996), nephews of Domingo Esteso, whose children and heirs continue the saga.\n", "The guitarists use the technique of ", ", ", ",", " the ", " and the ", ",", " among others. One of the first touches that is considered flamenco, such as the \"rondeña\", was the first composition recorded for solo guitar, by ", " (", ", 1832 – ", ", Málaga, 1882) in Barcelona in 1860. The strum can be performed with 5, 4 or 3 fingers, the latter invented by ", ". The use of the thumb is also characteristic of flamenco playing. Guitarists rest their thumb on the guitar's soundboard and their index and middle fingers on the string above the one they are playing, thus achieving greater power and sound than the classical guitarist. The middle finger is also placed on the pickguard of the guitar for more precision and strength when plucking the string. Likewise, the use of the pickguard as an element of percussion gives great strength to flamenco guitar playing. The melodic or flourishing phrase that is inserted between the chord sequences intended to accompany the couplet is called \"falseta\".", "\n", "The accompaniment and solo playing of flamenco guitarists is based on both the modal harmonic system and the tonal system, although the most frequent is a combination of both. Some flamenco songs are performed \"a palo seco\" (", "), without guitar accompaniment.\n", "According to the Royal Spanish Academy, \"cante\" is called the \"action or effect of singing any Andalusian singing\", defining \"flamenco singing\" as \"agitated Andalusian singing\" and cante jondo as \"the most genuine song.

As with any dance form, many different styles of flamenco have developed.\n", "In the 20th century, flamenco danced informally at gitano (Roma) celebrations in Spain was considered the most \"authentic\" form of flamenco. There was less virtuoso technique in gitano flamenco, but the music and steps are fundamentally the same. The arms are noticeably different from classical flamenco, curving around the head and body rather than extending, often with a bent elbow.\n", "\"Flamenco puro\" otherwise known as \"flamenco por derecho\" is considered the form of performance flamenco closest to its gitano influences. In this style, the dance is often performed solo, and is based on signals and calls of structural improvisation rather than choreographed. In the improvisational style, castanets are not often used.\n", "\"Classical flamenco\" is the style most frequently performed by Spanish flamenco dance companies. It is danced largely in a proud and upright style. For women, the back is often held in a marked back bend. Unlike the more gitano influenced styles, there is little movement of the hips, the body is tightly held, and the arms are long, like a ballet dancer. In fact, many of the dancers in these companies are trained in Ballet Clásico Español more than in the improvisational language of flamenco. Flamenco has both influenced and been influenced by Ballet Clásico Español, as evidenced by the fusion of the two ballets created by 'La Argentinita' in the early part of the 20th century and later, by ", ", eventually by the entire ", " et al.\n", "In the 1950s ", " was one of the most famous male flamenco dancers, performing on stage worldwide and on television including the ", ", and reviving the art almost singlehandedly. Greco's company left a handful of prominent pioneers, most notably: Maria Benitez and Vicente Romero of New Mexico. Today, there are many centers of flamenco art. Albuquerque, New Mexico is considered the \"Center of the Nation\" for flamenco art. Much of this is due to Maria Benitez's 37 years of sold-out summer seasons. Albuquerque boasts three distinct prominent centers: National Institute of Flamenco, Casa Flamenca and Flamenco Works. Each center dedicates time to daily training, cultural diffusion and world-class performance equaled only to world-class performances one would find in the heart of Southern Spain, Andalucía.\n", "Modern flamenco is a highly technical dance style requiring years of study. The emphasis for both male and female performers is on lightning-fast footwork performed with absolute precision. In addition, the dancer may have to dance while using props such as castanets, canes, shawls and fans.\n", "\"", "\" is a recent marketing phenomenon in flamenco. Marketed as a \"newer version\" of flamenco, its roots came from world-music promoters trying to sell albums of artists who created music that \"sounded like\" or had Spanish-style influences. Though some of this music was played in similar pitches, scales and was well-received, it has little to nothing to do with the art of flamenco guitar, dance, cante Jondo or the improvisational language. \"Nuevo flamenco\" consists largely of compositions and repertoire, while traditional flamenco music and dance is a language composed of stanzas, actuated by oral formulaic calls and signals.\n", "The flamenco most foreigners are familiar with is a style that was developed as a spectacle for tourists. To add variety, group dances are included and even solos are more likely to be choreographed. The frilly, voluminous spotted dresses are derived from a style of dress worn for the ", " at the annual ", " in ", ".\n", "In traditional flamenco, only the very young or older dancers are considered to have the emotional innocence or maturity to adequately convey the ", " (soul) of the genre (", "). Therefore, unlike other dance forms, where dancers turn professional through techniques early on to take advantage of youth and strength, many flamenco dancers do not hit their peak until their thirties and will continue to perform into their fifties and beyond. One artist that is considered a young master is Juan Manuel Fernandez Montoya, otherwise known as \"Farruquito\". At age 12, Farruquito was considered a pioneer and for \"Flamenco Puro\", or \"Flamenco por Derecho\", because of his emotional depth.\n", "In Spain, regulated flamenco studies are officially taught in various music conservatories, dance conservatories and music schools in various autonomous communities.", "\n", "Flamenco guitar studies in official educational centers began in Spain in 1988 at the hands of the great concert performer and teacher from Granada ", ",", " who obtained a position as emeritus professor at the ", " from Córdoba.\n", "There are specialized flamenco conservatories throughout the country, although mainly in the Andalusia region, such as the aforementioned Córdoba Conservatory, the ", " or the ", ", among others.
