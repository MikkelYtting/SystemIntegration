What is a Federated Identity Service?

Kort fortalt: A Federated Identity Service allows users to log in to multiple applications using a single set of credentials. 

This means users can authenticate once and gain access to various systems without needing to log in separately to each one. 
Federated identity services simplify the user experience by providing Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities and enhancing security by centralizing authentication and reducing the need for multiple passwords.
